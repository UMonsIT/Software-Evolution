\section{Introduction}
After major empirical studies, Lehman and Belady proposed a number of ``laws''
that seem to be applicable to all evolving software systems. These ``laws''
reflect the cooperative activity of many individuals and organisational
behaviour. Before reading these ``laws'', there are important points to
highlight:
\begin{itemize}
\item These ``laws'' are not really laws, they are more sensible observations.
\item They are applicable on large system developed by large organisation but
less applicable in other cases.
\end{itemize}

\section{Laws of Software Evolution}
\subsection{Continuing change}
Before giving this law, the notion of ``E-type program'' has to be defined:

\begin{definition}[E-type programs]
E is for evolutionary, theses programs solve
real-world problems, have their requirements and environment continuously
evolving and have a continuous need for change.
\end{definition}

Knowing what is an ``E-type'' program, the first law is the following:

\begin{law}
An ``E-type'' program that is used in a real-world environment must be
continually adapted, else it becomes progressively less satisfactory.
\end{law}

This law is due to the evolution of the environment increasing the mismatch
between the system and its environment.

\subsection{Increasing complexity}
\begin{law}
As a program is evolved, its complexity increases unless work is done to
maintain or reduce it.
\end{law}

This is due to the fact that small changes applied in a step-wise process
(patches) make sense locally but not globally.\\

To fix this, an effort is needed to reconcile accumulated changes with the
overall performance goals ($\leadsto$ refactoring and performance optimisation).

\subsection{Self regulation}
\begin{law}
Program evolution is a self-regulating process. System attributes such as
size, time between releases and the number of reported errors is approximately
invariant for each system release.
\end{law}

\subsection{Conservation of organisational stability}
\begin{law}
The average effective global activity rate on an evolving system is
invariant over the product life time.
\end{law}

This is due to managerial decisions (on effort) that are constrained by external
forces (e.g. resources, complexity).\\

In practice, the ``effective'' effort invested converges to a constant.

\subsection{Conservation of familiarity}
\begin{law}
Over the lifetime of a system, the incremental change in each release is
approximately constant.
\end{law}

\subsection{Continuing growth}
\begin{law}
Functional content of a program must be continually increased to maintain
user satisfaction over its lifetime.
\end{law}

This law implies the first law (Continuing change), except with focus on
functional requirements. Often, one can not afford to omit existing
functionality. Omitted attributes will become the bottlenecks and irritants in
usage as the user has to replace automated operations with human intervention.
Hence, they also lead to demand for change.

\subsection{Declining quality}
\begin{law}
E-type programs will be perceived as of declining quality unless rigorously
maintained and adapted to a changing operational environment.
\end{law}

This law implies the first law (Continuing change), except with focus on
observed reliability.\\

This law is due to the principle of Software Uncertainty:
\begin{definition}[Principle of Software Uncertainty]
Real world outcome of E-type software execution is inherently uncertain with
precise area of uncertainty also not knowable.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Feedback system}
\begin{law}
E-type programming process constitute multi-loop, multi-level feedback
systems and must be treated as such to be successfully modified or improved.
\end{law}

$\leadsto$ Emphasis on feedback from team members in an organisation.
