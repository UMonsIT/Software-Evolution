\section{Assessing the quality of a software}
There are many types of quality problems that can be detected in automatically
with many tools (or plugins) and techniques. These tools can be integrated into
the IDE, integrated into the version control system, available through a
dedicated web interface or even all the preceding possibilities combined.\\

Some tools rely on \textbf{static analysis} (detecting duplicate code, detecting
dependencies, detecting structural problems) where others rely on
\textbf{dynamic analysis} (code coverage analysis, profiling).

\begin{definition}[Static analysis]
Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed
without actually executing programs.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Dynamic analysis]
Dynamic program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed
by executing programs on a real or virtual processor.
\end{definition}

Many tools also use specific visualisation techniques.
